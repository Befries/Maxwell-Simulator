# Maxwell's Equation Simulator

It is a personnal project to train my coding skills in C.

## Usage

Ensure that the project is clean by using the command `make clean`.
The [GTK4 library](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/linux/) must be installed.
Use `make` to build the project

## Concept

The program uses the finite difference method on an eulerian point of view to simulate the electric
and magnetic fields.
